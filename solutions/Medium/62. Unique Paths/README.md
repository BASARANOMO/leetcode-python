# 62. Unique Paths
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

__Example 1:__

![Example 1](https://github.com/BASARANOMO/leetcode-python/blob/main/solutions/Medium/62.%20Unique%20Paths/robot_maze.png)
```
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```

__Example 3:__
```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

__Example 4:__
```
Input: m = 3, n = 3
Output: 6
```

__Constraints:__
- ```1 <= m, n <= 100```
- It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to ```2 * 109```.

## Solution
- Mathematical solution
- Dynamic programming
