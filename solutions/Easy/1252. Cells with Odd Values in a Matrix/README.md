# 1252. Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix

## Solution1

Simulation

Time comlexity: `O(q * (m + n) + m * n)` where `q` is the length of `indices`

Space comlexity: `O(m * n)`

## Solution2

Simulation

Time comlexity: `O(q + m * n)` where `q` is the length of `indices`

Space comlexity: `O(m + n)`

## Solution3

Simulation

Time comlexity: `O(q + m + n)` where `q` is the length of `indices`

Space comlexity: `O(m + n)`
